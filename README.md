# coreml-llm

This is a personal project where I’m exploring how to run large language models (LLMs) on Mac and
iPhone using CoreML. I’m particularly interested in taking advantage of the Apple Neural Engine
(ANE) to make the models as fast and efficient as possible. I’m also experimenting with ways to
optimize LLMs for iPhone.

## Llama

```sh
$ poetry run python ./llama/export-model.py
```
